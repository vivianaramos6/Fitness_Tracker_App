Usability Test Instructions for Paper Prototypes

General Instructions:
Imagine this is a fitness app you're using to stay healthy and connected.
For each task, point to or tap the part of the paper screen you would interact with.
You will be shown a new screen when something changes as a result of your action.


For the usability testing of both features there were two participants picked. Both software engineering students from University of Puerto Rico. The testing and questionnaire was performed by Viviana Ramos. 

PART 1: Goals Page Tasks
Scenario:
You’ve just joined a fitness app and want to set some personal and group goals, track your progress, and see your achievements.
Tasks:
Add a General Goal
* Locate and select the goal “Run 10 miles this week.”
* Add it to your weekly goals list.
Mark a Goal as Completed
* Imagine you’ve completed the goal.
* Mark it as completed.
View Achievements
* Scroll to or find the area where your achievement badges are displayed.
* Note which ones are unlocked vs locked.






Notes
*Users expected more flexibility in adding goals (e.g., custom goals).
*User 2 expected a dedicated goal-creation section
*Both users struggled to locate achievements





Post-Test Questions / Feedback
After completing all tasks, ask:
* What was confusing or unclear?
[User 1]: “When adding goals, can I only add goals from the suggested section?”
[User 2]: “Is there a goal limit?”


* What would you expect to happen that didn’t?


[User 1]: “I thought achievements would have its own section but could not find it. It's in the goals section”


[User 2]: “I thought there would be a section dedicated to goal creation” 




* How easy or hard was it to complete each task?


[User 1]: “Each task was fairly easy to complete, some were a bit annoying but still easy.”


[User 2}: “Completing tasks was pretty easy”


* What features would you add?


[User 1]: “I would add a custom goal button, and would change the achievements to their own section”
[User 2]: “I think the features are fine, but I would change the color palette”


**Both users successfully completed their tasks**



Results
*Limited Goal-Setting Options
  Hypothesis: Users expect more flexibility in setting personal goals beyond pre-defined suggestions.
  Fix: Add a "Create Custom Goal" button alongside suggested goals for personalized tracking.

*Hard-to-Find Achievements
  Hypothesis: Users assume achievements should have a dedicated section rather than being nested within goals.
  Fix: Move the Achievements section to a more visible section in the goals page.








PART 2: Fitness Groups Page Tasks
Scenario:
You’re interested in joining a community to help stay motivated with your workouts.
Tasks:
Join a Fitness Group
* Choose the Cycling group and join it.
Schedule a Joint Workout
* Schedule a joint workout with the group for the 21st of April, at 7:30am your time
Leave the Group
* Now imagine you're no longer interested in Cycling.
* Leave the group.


Notes
*User 1 found it unclear how to leave the group, expecting a dedicated button.
*User 2 struggled with differentiating between groups and other page sections 


Post-Test Questions / Feedback
After completing all tasks, ask:
* What was confusing or unclear?
[User 1]: “Leaving the fitness group was a bit confusing”
[User 2]: “the navigation bar was confusion because there is no differentiation between what is a group and what is a different part of the page itself”


* What would you expect to happen that didn’t?


[User 1]: “I thought there would be a button to leave the fitness group but there wasn't”


[User 2]: “ I expected an option to report or favorite a post upon clicking the action button on the post”




* How easy or hard was it to complete each task?
[User 1]: “Each task was fairly easy to complete”
[User 2]: “tasks felt easy to complete”
* What features would you add?


[User 1]: “Just one section for community in general where all your joined groups appear⁠”


[User 2]:  “I would add a feature to filter/sort user posts by different criteria”






**Both users successfully completed their tasks**




Results
*Small "Leave Group" Button
  Hypothesis: Users expect a very explicit way to exit a group.
  Fix: Increase size of "Leave Group" button in the group settings.

*Lack of Group Management Hub
  Hypothesis: Users want a centralized place for group management.
  Fix: Introduce a "My Groups" tab showing all memberships.
